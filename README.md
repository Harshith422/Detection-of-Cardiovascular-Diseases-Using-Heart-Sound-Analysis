# Detection of Cardiovascular Diseases Using Heart Sound Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  
This project develops a **machine learning-based system** for detecting **cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)** using **electrocardiogram (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) signals**. Advanced signal processing techniques such as **bandpass filtering, normalization, and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)** are used for feature extraction. The system follows a hierarchical classification approach:  
- **Binary classification**: Detects normal vs. abnormal signals  
- **Multi-class classification**: Identifies specific cardiovascular diseases  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Preprocessing** – Bandpass filtering & normalization for noise reduction  
✅ **Feature Extraction** – Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for time-frequency analysis  
✅ **Machine Learning Model** – Support Vector Machines (SVM) for traditional classification  
✅ **Deep Learning Model** – CNN-LSTM hybrid model for improved accuracy  
✅ **Hierarchical Classification** – Binary and multi-class disease classification  

## 🏗️ System Architecture  
The system consists of:  
- **Signal Preprocessing**: Bandpass filtering, normalization, CWT  
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting meaningful features from ECG & PCG signals  
- **Machine Learning Model**: SVM classifier for binary & multi-class classification  
- **Deep Learning Model**: CNN for spatial patterns + LSTM for temporal dependencies
